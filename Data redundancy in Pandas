#use only the cokumns you want , In thr real world Datasets might have alot of dimension(columns) in the relation databases so you need to reduce the dimension by reducing columns by using usecols params.

 import pandas as pd 

 #make a list of columns you want to use

 cols = ['col1','col2']

 data = pd.read_csv(datafile.csv, usecols=cols )




 #In real world dataset you might have alot of records and so much information so you will need to deal with a certain chunk of your data , you can use skiprows or nrows and list() method 

 first_20_records = pd.read_csv(data.csv)

 col_names = list(first_20_records) // this will get the column names 

 data_50_recods = pd.read_csv(nrows= 50, skiprows = 20 , header= None , names = col_names)
