# finding out the datatypes in your dataset

data = pd.read_csv(file.csv)

print(data.dtypes)


#some columns may contains 0 so replace 0 with NA (not available) becuase it is important because 0 is a value that may cause ambiguity later in analysis purpose
#create a dictionary to replace the columns with 0 value to NA

## Dealing with errors while import, sometimes it might happen that the file format is not something compatable with Pandas 

try:
  data = pd.read_csv("file.csv")
  
  print(data.head())
  
except pd.io.common.CParserError:
    print("Your data contained rows that could not be parsed.")
